You can find the javascript visualization of our heatmaps in:
	openwerx2017_virtualitics_1/code/visualization/heatmap/index.html

Additionally, all preprocessing (projections, incorporation of wind and current data, identification of satellites over areas of interest, computer vision to identify our hijacked ship) can be found in the scripts located in the code folder.

If you have any questions, please reach out to @sarthak in the #openwerx channel!
